# The Future Founder Promise

Do you want to build your own startup eventually but aren't quite ready? Work at one of the companies offering the Future Founder Promise!

## History

[GraphCDN](https://graphcdn.io) started offering the Future Founder Promise to their employees:

> Do you want to build your own startup eventually but aren't quite ready? Come work at GraphCDN, and we'll teach you everything we know about starting something new. Then, once you are ready to start your own company, we'll be your first angel investors and introduce you to all of our investors!

Once other startups started offering it as well we created this list to keep track of which companies to work for if you're a future founder.
