## How to get Involved

Future Founder Promise has partnered with [FounderCulture](https://FounderCulture.net) to provide resources to help you become a Founder someday. FounderCulture is a community of several hundred Founders + deep domain Subject Matter Experts that's improving the odds for Founders by codifying & sharing learnings from our community of experts. The community hosts a series of [virtual and in-person events](https://www.founderculture.net/c/public-events/?sort=asc) to help you gain the skills you'll need to start, build and scale a world-changing-company. 

## Companies: Why Pledge to support Future Founder Promise?

If you're the Founder of a scaling tech company, you probably remember what it was like at the very beginning of your journey. You probably also know that the best employees (especially in early-stage startups with unstructured environments) are the onest that have a Founder mentality. By making the FFP pledge to support your employees' eventual Founder aspirations, you're helping your company recruit the best people that will thrive in as leaders in your company, unblocking initiatives and working tirelessly to achieve success. 

## History of Future Founder Promise

[Stellate](https://stellate.co) started offering the Future Founder Promise to their employees:

> Do you want to build your own startup eventually but aren't quite ready? Come work at GraphCDN, and we'll teach you everything we know about starting something new. Then, once you are ready to start your own company, we'll be your first angel investors and introduce you to all of our investors!

Once other startups started offering it as well, we expanded the FFP pledge to deepen the involvement of othe companies who also wanted to make this pledge to support and recruit the best employees who would someday also become Founders.
